# Track Based Video Editing

I'm working on an online video editor that focuses on using tracks for editing without messing up the original content (non-destructive editing). You can add different tracks and play them. You can also edit the track. There is an ID of each track. There is start time and left and right time of every track. Just put the values and you will see the editor will only play the specific part of the video.
